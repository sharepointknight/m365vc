<h2><strong>PARTY CENTRAL<em> MUSIC DJs and DANCING</em></strong></h2>



<p>Let’s start with the Music and DJs.  The most popular Microsoft DJ is clearly Joey Snow.&nbsp; Because he’s been DJ at more Microsoft and SharePoint Parties than anyone as long as I&#8217;ve been involved.&nbsp; At this virtual party we have reached out to Joey and he&#8217;s on board!  We will be featuring mixes from the famous DJ Joey Snow and his high energy summertime mixes perfect for dancing.  You can check out some of his mix samples at <a href="https://www.spreaker.com/show/bash-music">Spreaker Bash Music</a> where he regularly drops some dope mixes.</p>
